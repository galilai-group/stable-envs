# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are listed here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Craftax: `CraftaxClassicPixels`, `CraftaxClassicSymbolic`, `CraftaxPixels` and `CraftaxSymbolic`
  run the upstream JAX simulator with all lanes in one jitted `vmap` (`craftax` / `craftax-gpu` extras).

### Changed

### Fixed

### Removed

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-14

Initial release.

### Added

- Batched environments in seven families: classic control, DM Control, Fetch, navigation,
  OGBench, PushT and PyFlyt Rocket Landing. 70 environments register when every extra is
  installed. A missing extra disables only its family; `snv.import_errors()` names it.
- Class-first API: `snv.CartPole(num_envs=..., device=...)`, plus `snv.make`, `snv.info`,
  `snv.list_envs` and `snv.list_families`.
- Batched stepping on CPU or GPU: one `step` call takes `[B, A]` actions for one transition or
  `[B, T, A]` for a sequence, and returns a validity mask instead of resetting finished lanes.
- Batched rendering: `render(state)` draws frames from a State without advancing the simulation.
- Save and restore: `get_state` / `set_state` with a complete TensorDict `State`.
- Variation spaces: `sample_variation` / `set_variation` and per-lane reset options, compatible
  with stable-worldmodel.
- Source-comparison tests: each environment is checked against the library it ports and against
  stable-worldmodel, for State, simulation, tasks and pixels.
- `stable-envs doctor` checks the driver, Warp and MuJoCo OpenGL setup per env family.
- `stable_envs.testing` measurement helpers, the `benchmarks/` harness and MkDocs documentation.
